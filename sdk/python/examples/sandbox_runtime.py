"""Select a sandbox runtime.

The Kata and Firecracker cases require at least one cluster node that
advertises the respective KVM-backed runtime. The Firecracker case uses the
deployment's default EROFS root; OCI/Nydus directory images are not supported
by that runtime.
Set AKERNEL_EXAMPLE_RUNC=true to include the optional runc runtime.
